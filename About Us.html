            <h1>Fart Studio Productions</h1>
            <p>Taking after our first project "Spark-a-Fart", Fart Studio Productions focuses on developing games via Roblox Studio. We aim to create games that can make your day.</p>

            <h1>Spark-a-Fart</h1>
            <p>Spark-a-Fart (name coined by QB) was brought to life by two college students who wanted to develop, make an impact, have fun, and collaborate during the summer.</p>
            
            <p>Spark-a-Fart has recently reached the pre-alpha phase in its development. Features which still need touching up are improved animation, added physics, improved code efficiency, improved modeling, added SFX, GUI, and added game art.</p>

            <p>Spark-a-Fart will be a comedic relief game, that people will have fun playing.</p>
